DAY-1 (17/2/2023)
=================
Events that trigger a Checkpoint:
--------------------------------
1. The physical log buffer becomes 75 % full.
2. The time specified by the CKPTINTVL parameter in the ONCONFIG file is reached.
3. The onmode –c command is used to request a sync checkpoint
4. During an archive.
5. During a rollback.
6. When the next to the last available logical log contains the last checkpoint. 

---------------------------------
=> If we want to identify the port information in any server
	cd /etc/server
	8080 is the default port number of Informix
	IBM has the Passport advantage feature from there we can download our installation files
		14.10.FC10 (F-> LINUX) // F->64 bit & T->32 bit
=> If we want to find the information about Server
	In Command prompt: uname -a
ARCHITECTURE:
-------------
1) DB SERVER: In DB server we can have multiple Instances
2) Instance: We can have: 
			  a. Memory(RAM)
			  b. Disk (For storage Purpose)
			  c. Processes (To Execute any operations we need processes)
3) We can create the Database in Instances

INSTANCE:
---------
1) Shared Memory (To provide space for performing any activity)

	Ex: select * from Customer;

	Evaluation of Query:
	--------------------
	1. The client can give query(High Level) to the Instance
	2. The Instance can allocate that query to the Shared Memory
	3. The Shared Memory can convert that query to the Binary format 
	4. After that the SM can initiate one thread (resourses) to the process
	5. The process can fetch the Data from the Disk and return back to SM
	6. The SM can give reply to the Client 
SHARED MEMORY:
-------------
=> Buffer Pool can provide the space to perform any activity
1) Physical Log Buffer: The database server uses the physical-log buffer to hold before-images of some of the modified dbspace pages.
2) Logical Log Buffer: The database server uses the logical log to store a record of changes to the database server at a since the last dbspace backup.
	Before Write => Physical LB (Before Update)
	After write  => Logical LB (After update)
	EX:           update
		a=10 -------->a=11
	      physical       Logical
	* The value should be 11, Because first it will search for Logical buffer and then it will return
	* Once we issue the Commit, then only the changes will effect in physical Log buffer.

* In Logical log buffer, If we insert any data, then if LLB is exceeds upto 100% then the Event will occurs then checkpoint will occurs.
* The check point can flush (writes) data from Logical Log Buffer to Logical Log 
* We can't perform the ROLLBACK operation in Informix
* Check point will occur to make the DB consistent

EVENTS:
-------
1: when logical log is used 100%

2: ckpt interval Parameter is 300 sec completed 

3: when external backup occur 

4: when you down the database checkpoint will occur 

* High Availability Data Replication (known as HDR) is intrinsic functionality within Informix On-Line which enables the replication of one instance to another, to add resilience.




How to down the Dbspace

AIX in flag positions

Read Ahead

ACID Properties
A-> Automicity
C-> Consistency
I-> Intigrity
D-> Durability

onstat -g ntt  => To get the time duration of BUFF read & write



Jun@1664

LOCKS -> To maintain the consistency of the DB we can use Locks (onstat -k)

Row-label lock => Only one row can lock



NSR Parameters:

alarm log file -> cd IDS/14.10/etc

crontab -l (Script)
